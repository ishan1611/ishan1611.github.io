## Grad Student at Stevens Institute of Technology | Software Dev. | Data Engg. | Seeking Full-time roles

## Summary

Graduate Student at Stevens Institute of technology.
Pursuing Master of Science in Computer Science.
I'm interested in Enterprise software development and data engineering. I'm focused on cloud and big data technologies and believe in adapting to new and better technologies; as you can see in my resume that I like doing extra curricular online courses.

Throughout my undergraduate studies, I've developed softwares in Java. Since then, in my fall semester at Stevens I've learnt various enterprise software architectures like:

Domain Driven designs
Object relational mapping (ORM)
Service Oriented Architecture- SOAP based web services
Resource Oriented Architecture- RESTful web services
Middleware Oriented Architecture
Event Driven Architecture

I've designed and developed web applications in each of the above paradigms in Java EE and deployed it on an Amazon EC2 instance.

Currently, I've been learning functional programming paradigm with scala, along with Spark and Hadoop frameworks.

I've worked as the vice president of a non profit organization - The Rotaract Club of Bombay Uptown in the year 2014-15 and have been an active member of the Rotaract for three years.
